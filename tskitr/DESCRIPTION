Description: Tskit enables performant storage, manipulation, and analysis
  of ancestral recombination graphs using succinct tree sequence encoding.
  See https://tskit.dev for project news, documentation, and tutorials.
  Tskit provides Python, C, and Rust APIs. The Python API can be called from R
  via the `reticulate` R package to seamlessly load and analyse
  a tree sequence as described at https://tskit.dev/tutorials/tskitr.html.
  `tskitr` provides R access to the tskit C API for use cases where the
  `reticulate` approach is not optimal. For example, for high-performance and
  low-level work with tree sequences. Currently, `tskitr` provides a very
  limited number of R functions due to the availability of extensive Python API
  and the `reticulate` approach.
