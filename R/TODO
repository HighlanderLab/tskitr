* Put any C/C++/Fortran code in 'inst' and build a README.md;
  see https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/tree/master/inst/include

  inst/include/
  inst/include/README - instructions on how to get armadillo code
  inst/include/armadillo - Rcpp/Armadillo glue, but maybe not needed with new versions?
  inst/include/RcppArmadillo.h - Rcpp/Armadillo glue, ???
  inst/include/current/armadillo - looks like a massive include from armadillo project
  inst/include/current/armadillo_bits/ - hpp files from armadillo project
  inst/include/legacy/ - like the current, but older code I reckon

  https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppNT2/tree/master/inst/include

  inst/include/
  inst/include/RcppNT2.h - includes for boost/*, nt2/*, RcppNT2/*
  inst/include/boost/ - boost files
  inst/include/nt2/ - nt2 files
  inst/include/RcppNT2/ - RcppNT2 files

* Develop package src code; see https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/tree/master/src

* Should we port any flags from the meson build system to R build system? --> these would go to PKG_CFLAGS or PKG_CXXFLAGS

* These two lines were in NAMESPACE from Rcpp.package.skeleton() but devtools wants to autogenerate it
importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp)
exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+")

* Any of this usefull to add to DESCRIPTION?
Depends: R (>= 4.0.0), methods, R6
Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown, testthat
VignetteBuilder: knitr
NeedsCompilation: true

* https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/blob/master/.Rbuildignore has
\.travis\.yml
^\.codecov.yml
^\.covrignore
^local
^vignettes/rmd

* Mention that tskit&kastore are MIT too - see https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/blob/master/inst/COPYRIGHTS

converters, a test framework, examples and more. It was written by Dirk
Eddelbuettel, Romain Francois and Doug Bates with contributions by many
others as detailed in the ChangeLog file.

* https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/blob/master/.codecov.yml looks useful

* https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/blob/master/.covrignore looks useful

* Add GitHub action; see https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/tree/master/.github/workflows
  and https://github.com/AlphaGenes/AlphaPart/tree/main/.github/workflows

* https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/blob/master/cleanup looks useful to remove temp files

* https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/tree/master/vignettes add a vignette at some point

* https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/tree/master/local looks useful to save code for issues etc.

* I hope we don't need stuff like this! https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/blob/master/configure

* Move R/NEWS.md to R/inst/NEWS.md?

* See these links on how to make tskitr available as a header library for other R packages (this is for using tskitr's C++ "interface" for C++ code in other packages)
