  Compiled code should not call entry points which might terminate R nor
  write to stdout/stderr instead of to the console, nor use Fortran I/O
  nor system RNGs nor [v]sprintf.

  See ‘Writing portable packages’ in the ‘Writing R Extensions’ manual.

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html says

Under no circumstances should your compiled code ever call abort or exit85: these terminate the user’s R process, quite possibly losing all unsaved work. One usage that could call abort is the assert macro in C or C++ functions, which should never be active in production code. The normal way to ensure that is to define the macro NDEBUG, and R CMD INSTALL does so as part of the compilation flags. Beware of including headers (including from other packages) which could undefine it, now or in future versions. If you wish to use assert during development, you can include -UNDEBUG in PKG_CPPFLAGS or #undef it in your headers or code files. Note that your own src/Makefile or makefiles in sub-directories may also need to define NDEBUG.
This applies not only to your own code but to any external software you compile in or link to.


Compiled code should not write to stdout or stderr and C++ and Fortran I/O should not be used. As with the previous item such calls may come from external software and may never be called, but package authors are often mistaken about that.

Compiled code should not call the system random number generators such as rand, drand48 and random86, but rather use the interfaces to R’s RNGs described in Random number generation. In particular, if more than one package initializes a system RNG (e.g. via srand), they will interfere with each other. This applies also to Fortran 90’s random_number and random_seed, and Fortran 2018’s random_init. And to GNU Fortran’s rand, irand and srand. Except for drand48, what PRNG these functions use is implementation-dependent.

Nor should the C++11 random number library be used nor any other third-party random number generators such as those in GSL.

Use of sprintf and vsprintf is regarded as a potential security risk and warned about on some platforms.87 R CMD check reports if any calls are found.
