\title{RcppTskit: R Access to the Tskit C API}
\description{
`Tskit` enables efficient storage, manipulation, and analysis of
ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) using succinct tree sequence encoding.
The tree sequence encoding of an ARG is described in Wong et al. (2024)
<doi:10.1093/genetics/iyae100>, while `tskit` project is
described in Jeffrey et al. (2026) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2602.09649>.
See also https://tskit.dev for project news, documentation, and tutorials.
`Tskit` provides Python, C, and Rust application programming interfaces (APIs).
The Python API can be called from R via the `reticulate` package to
load and analyse tree sequences as described at
https://tskit.dev/tutorials/tskitr.html.
`RcppTskit` provides R access to the `tskit` C API for cases where the
`reticulate` option is not optimal; for example; high-performance or low-level
work with tree sequences. Currently, `RcppTskit` provides a limited set of
R functions because the Python API and `reticulate` already covers most needs.
