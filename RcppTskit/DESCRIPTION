Description: 'Tskit' enables efficient storage, manipulation, and
    analysis of ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) using succinct tree
    sequence encoding. The tree sequence encoding of an ARG is described
    in Wong et al. (2024) <doi:10.1093/genetics/iyae100>. See also
    <https://tskit.dev> for project news, documentation, and tutorials.
    'Tskit' provides Python, C, and Rust application programming
    interfaces (APIs). The Python API can be called from R via the
    'reticulate' package to load and analyse tree sequences as described
    at <https://tskit.dev/tutorials/tskitr.html>. 'RcppTskit' provides R
    access to the 'tskit' C API for cases where the 'reticulate' option
    is not optimal; for example, high-performance or low-level work with
    tree sequences. Currently, 'RcppTskit' provides a limited set of R
    functions because the Python API and 'reticulate' already covers
    most needs.
