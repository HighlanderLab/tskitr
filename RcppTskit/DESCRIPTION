Description: 'Tskit' enables performant storage, manipulation, and
    analysis of ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) using succinct tree
    sequence encoding. The tree sequence encoding of an ARG is described
    in Wong et al. (2024) <doi:10.1093/genetics/iyae100>. See also
    <https://tskit.dev> for project news, documentation, and tutorials.
    'Tskit' provides Python, C, and Rust application programming
    interfaces (APIs). The Python API can be called from R via the
    'reticulate' R package to seamlessly load and analyse a tree sequence
    as described at <https://tskit.dev/tutorials/tskitr.html>. 'RcppTskit'
    provides R access to the 'tskit' C API for use cases where the
    'reticulate' option is not optimal. For example, for high-performance
    and low-level work with tree sequences. Currently, 'RcppTskit'
    provides a limited number of R functions due to the availability of
    extensive Python API and the 'reticulate' option.
