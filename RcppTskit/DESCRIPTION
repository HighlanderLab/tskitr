Description: Tskit enables performant storage, manipulation, and analysis
    of ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) using succinct tree sequence
    encoding.  See https://tskit.dev for project news, documentation, and
    tutorials.  Tskit provides Python, C, and Rust APIs. The Python API
    can be called from R via the `reticulate` R package to seamlessly load
    and analyse a tree sequence as described at
    https://tskit.dev/tutorials/RcppTskit.html. `RcppTskit` provides R
    access to the `tskit` C API for use cases where the `reticulate`
    option is not optimal. For example, for high-performance and low-level
    work with tree sequences. Currently, `RcppTskit` provides a limited
    number of R functions due to the availability of extensive Python API
    and the `reticulate` option.
